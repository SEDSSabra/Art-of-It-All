										An epidemic is a disease that affects a large number of people within a community , population or region.
									</li>
									<li>
										A pandemic is an epidemic that is spread over multiple countries or continents.
									</li>
									<li>
										Endemic is something that belongs to a particular people or country.
									</li>
									<li>
										An outbreak is a greater than anticipated increase in the number of endemic cases. It can also be a single case in a new area. If it is not quickly controlled , it can become an epidemic.
									</li>

								<h1>Endemic vs Pandemic</h1>

								A simple way to know the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic is to remember the “P” in pandemic , which means a pandemic has a passport. A pandemic is an epidemic that travels.
							</p>

							<p>
								<h1>Epidemic vs Endemic</h1>

								An epidemic is actively spreading, new cases of disease substantially exceed what is expected. More broadly, it is used to describe any problem that is out of control, such as “the opioid endemic”. An epidemic is often localized toa region, but the number of those infected in that region is significantly higher than normal. As an example, when COVID-19 was limited to Wuhan, China, it was an epidemic. The geographical spread turned into a pandemic. <br>
								<span style="line-height: 40px;">Endemics are a constant presence in a specific location.</span><br>
								<span style="margin-left: 40px;">Ex-: Malaria is an endemic to parts of Africa.</span>  

							</p>

							<p>
								<h1>
									Endemic vs Outbreak
								</h1>

								An endemic can lead to an outbreak , and an outbreak can happen anywhere. As a example, Dengue fever is endemic to certain regions of Africa , Central and South America . Mosquitoes in these areas carry dengue fever and transmit it from person to person. If an dengue infected person visited to a place where and is bitten by mosquitoes then the intersects then transferred the disease to other individuals they bit, which created an outbreak.
